# Electric Vehicle Population Data Project

Certainly! Let's go through each column in the "Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv" dataset and explain its purpose:

1. **VIN (1-10)**: This column contains the first 10 characters of the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) for each electric vehicle. The VIN is a unique identifier for a vehicle, and the first 10 characters can provide information about the vehicle's manufacturer, model, and other details.

2. **County**: This column indicates the county where the electric vehicle is registered or located.

3. **City**: This column specifies the city where the electric vehicle is registered or located.

4. **State**: This column indicates the state where the electric vehicle is registered or located.

5. **Postal Code**: This column provides the postal code (zip code) for the location of the electric vehicle.

6. **Model Year**: This column shows the model year of the electric vehicle.

7. **Make**: This column identifies the manufacturer of the electric vehicle.

8. **Model**: This column specifies the model name of the electric vehicle.

9. **Electric Vehicle Type**: This column categorizes the electric vehicle as either a Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) or a Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV).

10. **Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility**: This column indicates whether the electric vehicle is eligible for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle incentives or not.

11. **Electric Range**: This column provides the estimated electric range of the vehicle in miles. This is an important factor for BEVs, as it determines the distance the vehicle can travel on a single charge.

12. **Base MSRP**: This column shows the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the base model of the electric vehicle.

13. **Legislative District**: This column specifies the legislative district associated with the location of the electric vehicle.

14. **DOL Vehicle ID**: This column provides a unique identifier assigned by the Department of Licensing (DOL) for each electric vehicle.

15. **Vehicle Location**: This column provides the general location (latitude and longitude) of the electric vehicle, which can be useful for geographic analysis and visualization.

## Analysis and Insights:

### Estimated Market Size Analysis of Electric Vehicles in the United States:

Now, let’s move forward towards finding the estimated market size of electric vehicles in the United States. I’ll first count the number of EVs registered every year:

- In 2021, there were 19,063 EVs registered.
- In 2022, the number increased to 27,708 EVs.
- In 2023, a significant jump to 57,519 EVs was observed.
- For 2024, currently, 7,072 EVs are registered, which suggests partial data.

To forecast the total number of EVs expected to be registered in 2024, we can use a growth rate based approach from previous complete years. Additionally, using this growth rate, we can estimate the market size for the next five years.

### Conclusion:

From the analysis, we can see that:

- The number of actual EV registrations remained relatively low and stable until around 2010, after which there was a consistent and steep upward trend, suggesting a significant increase in EV adoption.
- The forecasted EV registrations predict an even more dramatic increase in the near future, with the number of registrations expected to rise sharply in the coming years.

Given the growing trend in actual EV registrations and the projected acceleration as per the forecast data, we can conclude that the EV market size is expected to expand considerably. The steep increase in forecasted registrations suggests that consumer adoption of EVs is on the rise, and this trend is likely to continue. Overall, the data points towards a promising future for the EV industry, indicating a significant shift in consumer preferences and a potential increase in related investment and business opportunities.
